**On the Grid**
===============

An additional feature of n2v is the *Grider* class. This class has a handfull of 
options to represent many quantities and operators on the grid. 

In order to use them. One must specify either 1) a grid in the appropriate format
or 2) a V_potential object from a psi4 calculation using a DFT method or built 
from scratch.
